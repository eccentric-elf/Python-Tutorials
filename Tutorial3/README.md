1.	Draw a star using turtle methods.
2.	Write a program to draw a pentagon using turtle.
3.	Write a program to draw a circle using turtle.
4.	Write a GUI based program that allows the user to convert temperature values between degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius.  The interface should have labeled entry fields for these two values. These components should arrange in a grid where the labels occupy the first row and the corresponding field occupy the second row. At start up the Fahrenheit field should contain 32 and the Celsius field contain 0.0.The third row in the window contain two command buttons ,labeled >>>> and <<<<.When the user presses the first button, the program should use the data in the Fahrenheit field to compute the Celsius value, which should then be output to the Celsius field. The second button should perform the inverse function?
5.	Write a program to draw a radial pattern with 10 hexagons.
6.	Write a GUI program to convert an input string to uppercase and displays the result.
7.	Write a GUI program to inputs the integer, computes the square root, and outputs the result and handles input errors by displaying a message box.
8.	Write a GUI-based program that plays a guess-the-number game in which the user guesses a number between 1 and 100 and the computer provides the responses. The window should display the user’s guesses with a label by saying, “Too large, try again,” or “Too small, try again.” When the user finally guesses the correct number, the program congratulates him and tells him the total number of guesses
9.	Write a GUI-based program that plays a guess-the-number game in which the computer guesses a number between 1 and 100 and the user provides the responses. The window should display the computer’s guesses with a label. The user enters a hint in response, by selecting one of a set of command buttons labeled Too small, Too large, and Correct. When the game is over, you should disable these buttons and wait for the user to click New game, as before.(university question)
10.	A bouncy program is defined as follows – The program computes and displays the total distance traveled by a ball, given three inputs—the initial height from which it is dropped, its bounciness index, and the number of bounces. Given the inputs write a GUI-based program to compute the total distance traveled.
11.	Write a Python program to find the quadrant of a point, say (x,y).
12.	Write a GUI program to convert an input string to uppercase and displays the result.
13.	Write GUI program to compute and displays the square root of an input number.
14.	Write a GUI program to inputs the integer, computes the square root, and outputs the result and handles input errors by displaying a message box.
